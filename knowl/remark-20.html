<div class="para">Now we are ready to prove Hilbert’s Basis Theorem. David Hilbert was a big influence in the early years of commutative algebra, in many different ways. Emmy Noether’s early work in algebra was in part inspired by some of his work, and he later invited her to join the Göttingen Math Department — many of her amazing contributions to algebra happened during her time in Göttingen. Unfortunately, some of the faculty opposed a woman joining the department, and for her first two years in Göttingen, Noether did not have an official position nor was she paid. Hilbert’s contributions also include three of the most fundamental results in commutative algebra — Hilbert’s Basis Theorem, the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem, and Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-noetherian.html#remark-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
