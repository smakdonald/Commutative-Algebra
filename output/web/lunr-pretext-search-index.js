  "title": "Generated Modules",
  "body": "Generated Modules   True success comes only when every generation continues to develop the next generation. John C. Maxwell  In many ways, commutative algebra is the study of finitely generated modules. While vector spaces make for a great first example of modules, many of the basic facts we are used to from linear algebra are often a little more subtle in commutative algebra. These differences are features, not bugs. The first big noticeable difference between vector spaces and general modules is that while every vector space has a basis, most modules do not.  Generated Module  basis free module generating set generators for an -module   Let be an -module and . The submodule of  generated by (also known as the submodule spanned by) , denoted , is the smallest (with respect to containment) submodule of containing . module generated by a subset   We say  generates  , or is a set of generators for , if , meaning that every element in can be written as a finite linear combination of elements in .    Basis   A subset of an -module is a basis of , if the set generates and is linearly independent. generating set  set of generators  basis of a module     Free Module   An -module M is a free  -module if admits at least one a basis. free module     Vector Space is a Free Module  Every vector space over a field is a free -module.   Free -module Isomorphic to Copies of   Every free -module is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of .    To construct such an isomorphism for the free -module , take a basis for and let be a map such that The condition that is a basis for is equivalent to being an isomorphism of -modules.    One of the key things that makes commutative algebra so rich and beautiful is that most modules are in fact not free. In general, every -module has a generating set --- for example, itself. Given some generating set for , we can always write a presentation presentation  EMPTY  for , but in general will have a nontrivial kernel. A nonzero kernel element corresponds to a relation between the generators. relation   Homomorphism Determined of Images of Elements   A homomorphism of -modules is completely determined by the images of the elements on any given set of generators for .    Generated Module Equivalencies   The following are equivalent:     generates as an -module.  Every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of the elements of with coefficients in .  The homomorphism , where is a free -module with basis in bijection with via , is surjective.         (1 2) Suppose generates as an -module. The definition of a generated submodule is that it is the smallest submodule containing all linear combinations of the generators of . Thus every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of .  (2 3) Suppose every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of the elements of with coefficients in , and let be defined as above. Let . Thus can be written in the form , where and and . As is in bijection with , we see that there exist such that for each . Thus the element maps to via .    (3 1) Suppose the homomorphism , where is a free -module with basis in bijection with via , is surjective. Thus for any there exists some such that . As is a basis for there exist such that . As is a homomorphism, we see that where each and each . Thus every element of can be written as a finite linear combination of elements of with coefficients in .        The equivalence between (1) and (2) in says that the submodule generated by is exactly the set of all finite linear combinations of elements in with coefficients in , which explains the notation .   Finitely Generated Module   We say that a module is finitely generated if we can find a finite generating set for finitely generated module    A better name might be finitely generatable , since we do not need to know an actual finite set of generators to say that a module is finitely generated.    An -module is cyclic if it can be generated by one element. cyclic module Equivalently, we can write as a quotient of by some ideal .    Indeed, given a generator for , the kernel of the map induced by is some ideal . Since we assumed that generates , is automatically surjective, and thus induces an isomorphism .     More generally, if an -module has generators, we can naturally think about it as a quotient of by the submodule of relations among those generators. More precisely, if is generated by , then the homomorphism of -modules that sends each of the canonical generators of to is surjective; more precisely, this is a presentation for . presentation By the , .   Macaulay 2  Defining free modules in Macaulay2 is straightforward:  i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z]; i2 : M = R^3 3 o2 = R o2 : R-module, free  Note that from now on and until we reset Macaulay2, whenever you write R it will be read as a ring, not a module; if instead you want to refer to the module , you can write it as R^1 . Alternatively, you can also use the command module and write module R . If you do calculations that require a module and not a ring, it is important to be careful about whether you write R or R^1 ; this is an easy way to get an error message.  If we want to define a module that happens to be an ideal, but we want to think about it as a module, we can use the command module to turn the ideal into a module:  i3 : I = ideal\"xy,yz\" o3 = ideal (x*y, y*z) o3 : Ideal of R i4 : N = module I o4 = image | xy yz | 1 o4 : R-module, submodule of R  If we forget that this is actually an ideal, and simply think about as a submodule of the module , we can also view this module as the image of a map, as we described in : if a submodule of has generators, we can view it as the the image of the map that sends each of the canonical generators of to the generators we chose for our module. In our example, our module is the image of the following map from to :  i5 : phi = map(R^1,R^2,{{x*y,y*z}}) o5 = | xy yz | 1 2 o5 : Matrix R <--- R i6 : L = image phi o6 = image | xy yz | 1 o6 : R-module, submodule of R  Note that above, when we first defined the module , Macaulay2 immediately stored that information in this exact way, as the image of the same map we just defined. This is useful to keep in mind when you see the results for a computation: if a module is given to us as the image of a matrix, then we are being told that our module is a submodule of some free module. If the matrix has rows, then that means our module is a submodule of . Each column corresponds to a generator of our module (as a submodule of ).  Of course that the modules , , and we have defined are all the same module: the ideal . It is our job to know that; depending on how you ask the question, Macaulay2 might not be able to identify this. Finally, we can also describe this module by saying that it has two generators, say and , and there is a unique relation between them: This means that our module is the quotient of by the submodule generated by the relation . We can write this as the quotient of by the image of a map landing in , meaning it is the cokernel of a map.  i7 : psi = map(R^2,R^1,{{-z},{y}}) o7 = | -z | | y | 2 1 o7 : Matrix R <--- R i8 : K = coker psi o8 = cokernel | -z | | y | 2 o8 : R-module, quotient of R  When a module is given to us in this format, as the cokernel of some matrix, we are essentially being given a presentation: the number of rows is the number of generators, while each column corresponds to a relation among those generators. If one the vector appears in a column of the matrix, that means that the generators satisfy the relation Keep in mind that when you do a calculation and the result is a module given to you in this format, Macaulay2 will not necessarily respond with a minimal presentation: one of the generators given might actually be a linear combination of the remaining ones, so there might be more generators than necessary, and there might be superfluous relations which follow as linear combinations of the others. You might be able to get rid of some superfluous generators and relations using the command prune . We will discuss this in more detail when we talk about local rings in .   "

Rings Have Unique Structure as -algebra   Any ring comes with a unique structure as a -algebra, since there is a unique ring homomorphism : the one given by .    Generated Algebra   Let be an -algebra with structure homomorphism and let be a set. The -algebra generated by a subset of , denoted , is the smallest (with respect to containment) subring of containing and . A set of elements  generates  as an -algebra if .    Note that there are two different meanings for the notation for a ring and set : one calls for a polynomial ring, and the other calls for a subring of something. If is a subset of elements of some other larger ring which is clear from context, then we are talking about the algebra generated by ; in contrast, if is a set of indeterminates, then we are talking about a polynomial ring in those variables.  This can be unpackaged more concretely in a number of equivalent ways.  Generated Algebra Equivalencies   The following are equivalent:    generates as an -algebra.    Every element in admits a polynomial expression in with coefficients in , i.e.     If is a polynomial ring on a set of indeterminates in bijection with , then the -algebra homomorphism is surjective.

We can also write the one-generated -algebra as a quotient of a polynomial ring in one variable: if is not a perfect square, the map in part (3) of this is and its kernel is generated by , so .  Similarly, the ring can be written as which is a quotient of , and the map from is     Macaulay2  Unfortunately, Macaulay2 does not understand subalgebras directly, only quotient rings. But as we have discussed, any -algebra can be thought of as a quotient of a polynomial ring over . For example, the Veronese algebra is a quotient of a polynomial ring over in variables, since it has algebra generators. More precisely, is the image of the map so by the , .  i4 : use R; i5 : aux = QQ[w_1 .. w_6] o5 = aux o5 : PolynomialRing i6 : p = map(R,aux,{x^2,x*y,x*z,y^2,y*z,z^2}) 2 2 2 o6 = map (R, aux, {x , x*y, x*z, y , y*z, z }) o6 : RingMap R <--- aux i7 : V = aux\/ker p o7 = V o7 : QuotientRing  To do calculations with , note that is actually , is , and so on.

Algebra Finite iff Quotient of Polynomial Ring  From the discussion above, we conclude that is a finitely generated -algebra if and only if is a quotient of some polynomial ring over in finitely many variables.  If is generated over by , we will use the notation to denote . Of course, for this notation to properly specify a ring, we need to understand how these generators behave under the operations; this is no problem if and are understood to be contained in some larger ring.   Jacobian Determinant and Generation   There are many basic questions about algebra generators that are surprisingly difficult. Let and . When do generate over ? It is not too hard to show that the Jacobian determinant Jacobian  must be a nonzero constant. It is a big open question whether this is in fact a sufficient condition!    "

Robert Browning  Module Finite   Given an -algebra , we say is module-finite over if it is finitely generated as an -module.    Instead of asking about how is generated as an algebra over , we can ask how it is generated as a module over . The notion of module-finite is much stronger than algebra-finite, since a linear combination is a very special type of polynomial expression.  Subsets of Generating Sets    If is a finitely generated -module, then any generating set for as an -module contains a finite subset that generates .  If the ring is algebra-finite over , then any generating set for as an -algebra contains a finite subset that also generates as an -algebra.     Let be a generating set for as an -module. If is a finitely generated -module, then we can find elements that generate as an -module. Since generates , for each we can find finitely many elements and -coefficients such The submodule of generated by all the contains the elements , but since , we conclude that is generated by those finitely many , and thus by a finite subset of .  The other proof is essentially the same, with the appropriate replacements: whenever we talk about a set that generates as an -module, we should instead consider a set that generates as an -algebra, and instead of taking linear combinations of elements we should consider polynomials in those elements with -coefficients.    Mod Finite and Algebra Finite Expressions   If is an -algebra,    is algebra-finite if and only if for some .   is module-finite if and only if for some .

Confucius  In field theory, there is a close relationship between (vector space-)finite field extensions and algebraic equations. The situation for rings is similar, but much more subtle.  Integral Element   Let be a ring, an -algebra, and an ideal. An element of is integral over if it satisfies an equation of the form An element of is integral over if In both cases, we say that and satisfy an equation of integral dependence over    FIX  Integral automatically implies algebraic, but the condition that there exists an equation of algebraic dependence that is monic is stronger in the setting of rings. This is very different to what happens over fields, where algebraic and integral are equivalent conditions.  Integral in   Consider the -algebra . The element is integral over    since it satisfies the equation of integral dependence .    in Not Integral in   Prove is not integral over    If are such that then multiplying by gives which is impossible for parity reasons (the left hand-side is odd!). Notice, in contrast, that is algebraic over , since it satisfies .    Integrally Closed   Consider an an inclusion of rings . The integral closure  integral closure of in is the set of elements in that are integral over . We say is integrally closed  integrally closed in if is its own integral closure in . The integral closure of a domain in its field of fractions is usually denoted by     Normal Domain   A normal domain is a domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions, meaning    Integers are a Normal Domain   The ring of integers is a integrally closed, meaning its integral closure in its fraction field is itself. The key idea to show this is similar to the argument we used is not integral over .    In fact, this is a special case of the fact that every UFD is normal.  UFDs are Normal   Show that every UFD is normal.     We cannot talk about the integral closure of a ring without specifying in what extension; the integral closures of in different extension can be very different. In , we saw that the integral closure of in contains at least and , while says that the integral closure of in is .  When is a domain, if we ever refer to the integral closure of , it is understood that we mean the integral closure of in its field of fractions, .    An element is integral over if and only if is integral over the subring , so we might as well assume that is injective.   F.G.-by-Intl-Modfin   Consider a ring extension .   If is integral over , then is module-finite over .    If are integral over , then is module-finite over .        Let be integral over , with for some . We claim that . Since is generated by all the powers of as an -module, to show that any polynomial is in it is enough to show that for all .   Using induction on , the base cases follow from the fact that is contained in the -th component. For the induction step, we need to show that for all ; we can do this by induction because we can use the equation above to rewrite as which is a linear combination of powers of of degree up to .   Write Since is integral over , it is also integral over , via the same monic equation that satisfies over . By Part (a), we conclude that the each extension is module-finite. Thus the inclusion is a composition of module-finite maps, and thus by this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Compositions Preserve Module Finite|Lemma]] it is also module-finite.     In what follows, we will need the following elementary linear algebra fact, which is actually very useful in various contexts within commutative algebra. In fact, later in this class we will use this useful fact again, perhaps when you least expect it. This is a nice example of an algebra fact that holds over any ring that we can actually reduce to the case of fields.  Classical Adjoint   The classical adjoint of an matrix is the matrix with entries where  is the matrix obtained from by deleting its th row and th column. classical adjoint    Determinantal Technique  determinantal technique   Let be a ring, , , and . (a) . (b) If , then .     When is a field, this is a basic linear algebra fact. We will deduce the case of a general ring from the field case. The ring is a -algebra, so we can write as a quotient of some polynomial ring . Let be a surjection, be such that and let . Note that since is a homomorphism, and the entries are the same polynomial functions of the entries of the matrices and , respectively. Thus, it suffices to establish in the case when , and we can do this entry by entry. Now, is an integral domain, hence a subring of a field (its fraction field). Since both sides of the equation live in and are equal in the fraction field (by linear algebra) they are equal in . This holds for all , and thus 1) holds.  By assumption, we have , so by part 1)      Module Finite Implies Integral   Let be module-finite. Then is integral over .    Given , we want to show that is integral over . The idea is to show that multiplication by , realized as a linear transformation over , satisfies the characteristic polynomial of that linear transformation.  Suppose that . We may assume that , perhaps by adding a module generator. Since every element in is an -linear combination of , this is in particular true for the elements . Thus we can find such that for each . Consider the matrix and the column vector . We can now write the equalities above more compactly as . By the Determinantal Technique, . Since we chose one of the entries of to be , we have in particular that . Expanding this determinant as a polynomial in , this is a monic equation with coefficients in .    We are now ready to show the following important characterization of module-finite extensions, which tells us exactly what we need besides algebra-finite to force an extension to be module-finite:  Mod Fin iff Integral and Alg Fin   An -algebra is module-finite over if and only if is integral and algebra-finite over .    ( ): Module-finite implies integral, and algebra-finite.  ( ): If is integral over , then each is integral over , and this implies is module-finite over .    Extensions Gen by Integral Elements are Integral   If is generated as an algebra over by integral elements, then is integral over .    Let , with integral over for all . Given , there is a finite subset such that . This is now a finitely-generated algebra generated by integral elements, and thus it must be module-finite over . Module-finite implies integral, and thus is an integral extension of . In particular, is integral over .    Integral Elements form Subring   Given any ring extension , the set of elements of that are integral over form a subring of .    By the -subalgebra of generated by all elements in that are integral over is integral over , so it is contained in the set of all elements that are integral over : this means that so equality holds throughout, and is a ring contained in by definition.    In other words, the integral closure of in is a subring of containing .   Integral Over      The ring , where is not a perfect square, is integral over . Indeed, satisfies the monic polynomial , and since the integral closure of is a ring containing and , and is the smallest such ring, we conclude that every element in is integral over .    Let . Then we claim that is module-finite over To see this we first need to realize as a subring of . To do that, consider the -algebra homomorphism The kernel of consists of the polynomials in and that are multiples of , but any nonzero multiple of in must have -degree at least , which implies it involves and thus it is not in . We conclude that is injective, and thus   Now is generated over as an algebra by one element, , and satisfies the monic equation , so is integral over .       Note, however, that not all integral extensions are module-finite.   Integral but Not Algebra or Module Finite   Let be a field, and consider the -algebra given by Note that satisfies the monic polynomial , and thus it is integral over . Since is generated by elements that are integral over , by it must be an integral extension of . However, is not algebra-finite, and thus it is also not module-finite.     Tower Integral iff Each Piece Integral   Given ring extensions , the extensions and are integral if and only if is integral.    Finally, here is a useful fact about integral extensions that we will use multiple times.   Int Ext Domains Field   If is an integral extension of domains, then is a field if and only if is a field.    Suppose that is a field, and let be a nonzero element, which is necessarily integral over . The ring is algebra-finite over by construction, and integral over . Since is integral and algebra-finite, it must also be module-finite. Since is a field, this means that is a finite-dimensional vector space over . Since is a domain, the map is injective. Notice that this is a map of finite-dimensional -vector spaces, and thus it must also be surjective. In particular, there exists an element such that and thus is invertible. We conclude that must be a field.  Now suppose that is a field, and let . Since , there exists an inverse for in , which must be integral over . Given any equation of integral dependence for over , say with , we can multiply by to obtain Therefore, is invertible in , and is a field.    Before we move on from algebra-finite and module-finite extensions, we should remark on what the situation looks like over fields. First, note that over a field, module-finite just means finite dimensional vector space. While over a general ring the notions of algebra-finite and module-finite are quite different, they are actually equivalent over a field. This is a very deep fact, and we will unfortunately skip its proof ‚Äî since it is a key ingredient in proving a fundamental result in algebraic geometry, we will leave it for the algebraic geometry class next semester. This is a nice application of the Artin-Tate Lemma, which we are going to discuss shortly, together with some facts about transcendent elements.   Zariski's Lemma   A field extension is algebra-finite if and only if it is module-finite.    The following corollary follows immediately from what we proved in this section:   Alg-Fin Ext of Alg Closed Field   Let be an algebraically closed field. If the field extension is algebra-finite, then .    By Zariski's Lemma, must be module-finite, making the extension integral. When we are over a field, integral is the same as algebraic, but integrally closed fields have no nontrivial algebraic extensions.    "

Nan Shepherd     Noetherian Rings  Most rings that commutative algebraists naturally want to study are noetherian. Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether, who is in many ways the mother of modern commutative algebra.  Noetherian Ring  noetherian ring   Suppose is a commutative ring. Then is called a noetherian ring if satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals - i.e., for every chain of ideals of  there exists a positive integer such that for all .     Equivalent Noetherian Ring Definitions   Let be a ring. The following are equivalent:    is a noetherian ring.  Every nonempty family of ideals has a maximal element (under ).  Every ascending chain of finitely generated ideals of stabilizes.  Given any generating set for an ideal , is generated by a finite subset of .  Every ideal of is finitely generated.     (1) (2): Suppose there is a nonempty family of ideals with no maximal element. This means that we can keep inductively choosing larger ideals from this family to obtain an infinite properly ascending chain, so is not noetherian.  (2) (1): An ascending chain of ideals is a family of ideals, and the maximal ideal in the family indicates where our chain stabilizes.  (1) (3): Contained within the definition of a noetherian ring.  (3) (4): Suppose that there is an ideal and a generating set for such that no finite subset of generates . So for any finite we have , so there is some Thus, . Inductively, we can continue this process to obtain an infinite proper chain of finitely generated ideals, so (c) does not hold.  (4) (5): This is the definition of being finitely generated.  (5) (1): Given an ascending chain of ideals let . In general, the union of two ideals might fail to be an ideal, but the union of a chain of ideals is an ideal (exercise). By assumption, the ideal is finitely generated, say . Now since each is in , it must be in some , by definition. Thus for any , we have . But then , and thus for all . Thus the original chain stabilizes, and is noetherian.     When we say that every non-empty family of ideals has a maximal element, that maximal element does not have to be unique in any way. An ideal is maximal in the family if for some implies . However, we might have many incomparable maximal elements in . For example, every element in the family of ideals in given by is maximal.    If is a noetherian ring and is a non-empty set of ideals in , not only does have a maximal element, but every element in must be contained in a maximal element of . Given an element , the subset of of ideals in that contain is nonempty, and must then contain a maximal element by . If for some , then , so , and thus by maximality of in , we must . This proves that is in fact a maximal element in , and by construction it contains .   Examples of Noetherian Domains      If is a field, the only ideals in are and , so is a noetherian ring.     is a noetherian ring, since all ideals are principal. More generally, if is a PID, then is noetherian. Indeed, every ideal is finitely generated!    As a special case of the previous example, consider the ring of germs of complex analytic functions near ,  This ring is a PID: every ideal is of the form , since any can be written as for some , and any such is a unit in .    A ring that is not noetherian is a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables over a field , : the ascending chain of ideals does not stabilize.    The ring is not noetherian. A nice ascending chain of ideals is     The ring of continuous real-valued functions  is not noetherian. The chain of ideals is increasing and proper. The same construction shows that the ring of infinitely differentiable real functions  is not noetherian: properness of the chain follows from, e.g., Urysohn's lemma (though it's not too hard to find functions distinguishing the ideals in the chain). Note that if we asked for analytic functions instead of infinitely-differentiable functions, every element of the chain would be the zero ideal!        Quotient Noetherian   Let be a ring and an ideal in . If is noetherian, then so is .    There is an order preserving bijection that sends the ideal to ; its inverse is the map that sends each ideal in to its preimage. Given this bijection, chains of ideals in come from chains of ideals in that contain . This implies that if is noetherian, then is noetherian as well.    This gives us many more examples of noetherian rings, by simply taking quotients of the examples above. We will soon show that any polynomial ring over a noetherian ring is also noetherian; as a consequence, we obtain that any quotient of a polynomial ring over a field is noetherian. This is the content of Hilbert's Basis Theorem.  But first, we need to talk about noetherian modules.    Noetherian Modules  Noetherian Module  noetherian module   An -module is noetherian if every ascending chain of submodules of eventually stabilizes.     Equivalent Definitions for Noetherian Module   Let be an -module. The following are equivalent:    is a noetherian module.    Every nonempty family of submodules has a maximal element.    Every ascending chain of finitely generated submodules of eventually stabilizes.    Given any generating set for a submodule , the submodule is generated by a finite subset of .    Every submodule of is finitely generated. In particular, a noetherian module must be finitely generated.        Noetherian Ring iff Noetherian Module over Itself   A ring is a noetherian ring if and only if is noetherian as a module over itself.     Noeth Ring Not Noeth Mod over Subring   A noetherian ring need not be a noetherian module over a subring.    For example, consider . These are both noetherian rings but is not a noetherian -module; for example, the following is an ascending chain of submodules which does not stabilize:      Noetherianity in Exact Sequences   In an exact sequence of modules is noetherian if and only if and are noetherian.    Assume is noetherian. Since is a submodule of , and its submodules are also submodules of , is noetherian. Moreover, any submodule of is of the form for some submodule of . Since every submodule of is finitely generated, every submodule of is also finitely generated. Therefore, is noetherian.  Conversely, assume that and are noetherian, and let be a chain of submodules of . First, note that is an ascending chain of submodules of , and thus it stabilizes. Moreover, is a chain of submodules of , and thus it also stabilizes. Pick a large enough index such that both of these chains stabilize. We claim that , so that the original chain stabilizes as well. To show that, take . Then so we can choose some such that . Then . Now note that , so , and thus Then , and since , we must have as well.     Direct Sums are Noetherian   If and are noetherian -modules, then is a noetherian -module.    Apply the previous to the short exact sequence      Module Powers are Noetherian   A module is noetherian if and only if is noetherian for some . In particular, if is a noetherian ring then is a noetherian module.    We will do induction on . The case is a tautology. For , consider the short exact sequence  and the inductive hypothesis give the desired conclusion.     Submodule of F.G. Module F.G   Let be a noetherian ring. Given an -module , is a noetherian -module if and only if is finitely generated. Consequently, any submodule of a finitely generated -module is also finitely generated.    If is noetherian, is finitely generated, and so are all of its submodules.  Now let be noetherian and be a finitely generated -module. Then is isomorphic to a quotient of for some , which is noetherian by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Corollary - Module Powers are Noetherian|Corollary]] and [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Quotient Noetherian|Lemma]].     Noetherian Required for Noetherian F.G   If is a non-noetherian ring and is a finitely generated -module, might not be noetherian.    For a dramatic example, note that itself is a finitely generated -module, but not noetherian.      Hilbert's Basis Theorem  Now we are ready to prove Hilbert's Basis Theorem. David Hilbert was a big influence in the early years of commutative algebra, in many different ways. Emmy Noether's early work in algebra was in part inspired by some of his work, and he later invited her to join the G√∂ttingen Math Department ‚Äî many of her amazing contributions to algebra happened during her time in G√∂ttingen. Unfortunately, some of the faculty opposed a woman joining the department, and for her first two years in G√∂ttingen, Noether did not have an official position nor was she paid. Hilbert's contributions also include three of the most fundamental results in commutative algebra ‚Äî Hilbert's Basis Theorem, the Hilbert Syzygy Theorem, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.   Hilbert's Basis Theorem   If is a noetherian ring, then the polynomial rings and are noetherian for any .    We will give the proof for polynomial rings, and at the end we will indicate what the difference is in the argument for the power series ring case. First, note that by induction on , we can reduce to the case .  Given an ideal , consider the set of leading coefficients of all polynomials in , By the [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Exercise - Hilbert Basis Lemma|Hilbert Basis Lemma]], we see that this is an ideal of . Since is noetherian, is finitely generated, so let . Pick such that the leading coefficient of is , and set .  Let . The leading coefficient of is an -linear combination of . If has degree greater than , then we can cancel off the leading term of by subtracting a suitable combination of the . Therefore, any can be written as for some and with degree at most . In particular, note that Since is a submodule of the finitely generated free -module , it must also be finitely generated as an -module. Given such a generating set, say , we can write any element as an -linear combination of these generators and the original . Therefore, is finitely generated as an ideal in , and is a noetherian ring.  In the power series case, take to be the set of coefficients of lowest degree terms.     We can rephrase in a way that can be better understood by those with high school algebra (as opposed to abstract algebra) knowledge:   Any system of polynomial equations in finitely many variables can be written in terms of finitely many equations.    Finally, note that a standard corollary of the Hilbert Basis Theorem is that finitely generated algebras over noetherian rings are also noetherian.   F.G. Algebras over Noeth Rings are Noeth   If is a noetherian ring, then any finitely generated -algebra is noetherian. In particular, any finitely generated algebra over a field is noetherian.    Any finitely generated -algebra is isomorphic to a quotient of a polynomial ring over in finitely many variables; polynomial rings over noetherian rings are noetherian by the , and quotients of noetherian rings are noetherian.     The converse to this statement is false: there are lots of noetherian rings that are not finitely generated algebras over a field. For example, is not algebra-finite over . We will see more examples of these when we talk about local rings.   Finally, we can now prove a technical sounding result that puts together all our finiteness conditions in a useful way.   Artin-Tate Lemma   Let be rings. Assume that    is noetherian,     is module-finite over , and     is algebra-finite over . Then, is algebra-finite over .       Let and . Then, for some . Let . This is a finitely generated -algebra; by this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Corollary - F.G. Algebras over Noeth Rings and Noeth|Corollary]], since is noetherian, so is .  We claim that . Given an element , write as a polynomial expression in . Since the are linear combinations of the with coefficients in the we have . Then using the equations for repeatedly, we can rewrite as a linear combination of the with coefficients in .  Since is noetherian and is a finitely generated -module, is a noetherian -module, by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Proposition - Submodule of F.G. Module F.G.|Proposition]]. Since , then is also a finitely generated -module. In particular, is algebra-finite. Since is algebra-finite, we conclude that is algebra-finite, as required.     "

Graded Ring   Let be a monoid; in many examples we will take , which is a monoid since we follow the convention that is a natural number. A ring is - graded  -graded -graded graded ring if we can write a direct sum decomposition of as an abelian group indexed by , such that This means that for all and , we have .    Homogeneous Element   An element in one of the summands of is said to be homogeneous  homogeneous element of degree  degree of homogeneous element  ; we write  or  to denote the degree of a homogeneous element .    Homogeneous Component   By definition, an element in a graded ring is a unique sum of homogeneous elements, which we call its homogeneous  homogeneous components  graded components or graded components . One nice thing about graded rings is that many properties can usually be checked on homogeneous elements, and these are often easier to deal with.    Graded Ring Properties   Let be a -graded ring.    is homogeneous of degree (the identity of ).   is a subring of .  Each is an -module.       Write with homogeneous of degree . Then implies for .

By assumption, is a subgroup under addition. Given and we must have .      Graded Ring Examples     Any ring is trivially an -graded ring, by setting and for .    If is a field and is a polynomial ring, there is an -grading on called the standard grading  standard grading where is the -vector space with basis given by the monomials of total degree , meaning those of the form with . For example, is homogeneous in the standard grading, while is not.    If is a field, and is a polynomial ring, we can give different -gradings on by fixing some tuple and letting be a homogeneous element of degree ; we call this a grading with weights  weights  . For example, in , is not homogeneous in the standard grading, but it is homogeneous of degree under the -grading with weights .    A polynomial ring also admits a natural -grading: the grading with . This is called the fine grading  fine grading     Let be a subsemigroup of . Then is an -graded subring of with the fine grading. Moreover, every -graded subring of is of this form.      Macaulay2  Polynomial rings in Macaulay2 are graded with the standard grading by default. To define a different grading, we give Macaulay2 a list with the grading of each of the variables:  i1 : R = ZZ\/101[a,b,c,Degrees=>{{1,2},{2,1},{1,0}}];  We can check whether an element of  isHomogeneous , and the function degree applied to an element of returns the least upper bound of the degrees of its monomials:  i2 : degree (a+b) o2 = {2, 2} o2 : List i3 : isHomogeneous(a+b) o3 = false    You may have seen the term homogeneous polynomial used to refer to a polynomial that satisfies for all and some fixed . This is equivalent to saying that all the terms in have the same total degree , or that is homogeneous with respect to the standard grading.  Similarly, a polynomial is quasi-homogeneous , quasi-homogenous polynomial or weighted homogeneous or , if there exist integers such that the sum is the same for all monomials appearing in . So satisfies for all and is homogeneous (in the previous sense, so with respect to the standard grading).  This condition is equivalent to asking that be homogeneous with respect to some weighted grading on .    Quasi-Homogeneous  In , the element is not homogeneous in the standard grading, but it is homogeneous (of degree 30) if we set , , and . This tells us that is quasi-homogeneous; it is homogeneous with respect to the weights . Indeed,     Homogeneous Ideal   An ideal in a graded ring is called homogeneous  homogenous ideal if it can be generated by homogeneous elements.     Equivalent Homogeneous Ideal Definitions   Let be an ideal in a graded ring . The following are equivalent:    is homogeneous.    For any element we have if and only if every homogeneous component of lies in .     , where .         (1) (2): Let be homogeneous generators for . If , we can write as We can also write each as a sum of its components, say . Then, after substituting and collecting, expresses as a sum of homogeneous elements of different degrees, so     (2) (1): Any element of is a sum of its homogeneous components. Thus, in this case, the set of homogeneous elements in is a generating set for .

Local Ring of the Point   If is algebraically closed and is a radical ideal, then is the coordinate ring of some affine variety, and is the ideal defining the origin (as a point in ). Then we call the local ring of a point local ring of a point  ; some people write this as . The radical ideals of this ring consist of radical ideals of that are contained in , which by the Nullstellensatz correspond to subvarieties of that contain . Similarly, we can define the local ring at any point .    Localization Ideals   Let be multiplicatively closed in . (a) If is an ideal in , then . (b) If is an ideal in , then . (c) If is an ideal in , then . (d) If is prime and , then is prime. (e) The map is injective, with image       Note that while is the ideal generated by all the elements of the form Since we can rewrite and , we conclude that .    If for some , then Conversely, if , then that means that By definition of the equivalence relation defining , this means that there exists such that Since is multiplicatively closed, , and thus the element satisfies .    The containment holds for general reasons: given any map , and a subset of the target of , . On the other hand, if , then , since its a unit multiple of an element of , and thus , so .    First, since , and is prime, no element of kills in , so is nonzero in . Thus, is nonzero, and a localization of a domain, hence is a domain. Thus, is prime.    First, by part b), the map , for sends primes to primes. We claim that         #empty     are inverse maps.  We have already seen that for any ideal in .  If , then using part a) and the definition of prime, we have that     Map on Spec Localization Prime   Let be a ring and be a prime ideal in . The map on spectra induced by the canonical map corresponds to the inclusion     Module Localization   Let be a ring, be a multiplicative set, and an -module. The localization localization of a module of at is the -module where is the equivalence relation if for some . The operations are given by     We will use the notations and analagously to and .  If is not a domain, the canonical map is not necessarily injective.  has Non Injective Canonical Maps      Consider . The canonical maps and are not injective, since in both cases is invertible in the localization, and thus     Annihilator   The annihilator annihilator of a module is the ideal     Colon Ideal   Let and be ideals in a ring . The colon colon of and is the ideal More generally, if and are submodules of some -module , the colon of and is     Annihilators and Colons are Ideals   The annihilator of is an ideal in , and Moreover, any colon is an ideal in .      If is a cyclic -module, then for some ideal .    Notice that , and that given an element , we have if and only if . Therefore, .    Ideals Contained in Annihilator   Let be an -module. If is an ideal in such that , then , and thus is naturally an -module with the same structure it has as an -module, meaning for each .    Annihilator of Quotient is Colon   If are -modules, then .    Zero in Localization   Let be an -module, and a multiplicative set. Then the following are equivalent: - - - Note in particular that this holds for .    For the first equivalence, we use the equivalence relation defining to note that in if and only if there exists some such that . The second equivalence just comes from the definition of the annihilator.    Canonical Localization Map and Injectivity   As a consequence of , it follows that if is a domain, then the canonical map is always injective for any multiplicatively closed set , since every nonzero has .  Notice, however, that even when is a domain, the elements in a module may still have nontrivial annihilators, and thus may fail to be injective.    Induced Localization Module Homomorphism   If is an -module homomorphism, then there is a -module homomorphism given by the rule .    Proving this lemma actually requires some homological algebra that we do not have, so for now we will just believe it.    Hom and Localization   Let be a noetherian ring, be a multiplicative set, be a finitely generated -module, and an arbitrary -module. Then, In particular, if is prime,     Localization is Exact   Given a short exact sequence of -modules and a multiplicative set , the sequence is also exact.    Localization Preserves Inclusions   It follows from this [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Zero in Localization|Lemma]] that if is injective, then is also injective, since So this explains some of [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Localization is Exact|Theorem]], since it shows that localization preserves inclusions.    Localizations and Quotients Commute   Given a submodule of , we can apply the [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Localization is Exact|Theorem]] to the short exact sequence and conclude that that .    Localization Commutes with Finite Intersections   Let be a module, and be a finite collection of submodules. Let be a multiplicative set. Then,     The containment is clear. Elements of are of the form ; we can find a common denominator to realize this in .    "

  "body": " Primary Decomposition     How weird was it that so many bits and pieces, all diverse, could make someting whole. Something with potential. Perfect.   Sarah Dessen    We refine our decomposition theory once again, and introduce primary decompositions of ideals. One of the fundamental classical results in commutative algebra is the fact that every ideal in any noetherian ring has a primary decomposition. This can be thought of as a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:   Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic   Every nonzero integer can be written as a product of primes: there are distinct prime integers and integers such that Moreover, such a a product is unique up to sign and the order of the factors.     We will soon discover that such a product a primary decomposition, perhaps after some light rewriting. But before we get to the and the of primary decomposition, it is worth discussing the . If we wanted to extend the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to other rings, our first attempt might involve irreducible elements. Unfortunately, we don't have to go far to find rings where we write elements as a unique product of irreducibles up to multiplying by a unit.    In , are two ways to write as a product of irreducible elements. In fact, we cannot obtain or by multiplying or by a unit.   Primary Ideal   We say that an ideal is primary primary ideal if We say that an ideal is - primary -primary ideal , where is prime, if is primary and .    Radical of Primary Ideal is Prime   The radical of a primary ideal is prime.    Suppose that is primary and . Then for some . If , then . Since is primary, we must have , so .    Prime Ideals are Primary   Any prime ideal is also primary.    Principal Primary Ideals in UFDs   If is a UFD, we claim that a principal ideal is primary if and only if it is generated by a power of a prime element.    Indeed, if , with irreducible, then Conversely, if is not a prime power, then , for some , nonunits with no common factor, then take but and .    Primary Ideals in   The nonzero primary ideals in are of the form for some prime and some . This example is a bit misleading, as it suggests that primary ideals are the same as powers of primes. We will soon see that it not the case.    Primary in   In , the ideal is primary.    Give the grading with weights and . If , then has a degree zero term. If , then has a term of degree zero or one. The product has a term of degree zero or one, so is not in .    Not Primary in   In , the ideal is not primary, even though is prime.    The offending product is : we have and .     One thing that can be confusing about primary ideals is that the definition is not symmetric. For to be a primary ideal, given a product , the definition says that if , then , and it also says that if , then . In , we found that and , so is not primary. Notice that if we switch the roles of and , we do have , but that is not sufficient to make a primary ideal.   Characterization of Primary Ideals   If is noetherian, the following are equivalent: (a) is primary. (b) Every zerodivisor in is nilpotent on . (c) is a singleton. (d) has exactly one minimal prime, and no embedded primes. (e) is prime and for all with , . (f) is prime, and .     : Saying is a zerodivisor modulo if there is some with . So the condition that every zerodivisor on must be nilpotent is equivalent to This is exactly the condition that is a primary ideal.   : First, note that the associated primes of are the associated primes of the ideal , while the minimal primes of are the minimal primes of . By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Zerodivisors Associated Primes|Theorem]], Every minimal prime of is associated to , so Finally, every nilpotent element is always a zerodivisor. Putting all these together, we always have the following: On the one hand, (2) says that the set of zerodivisors on coincides with the elements in the nilradical of ; thus (2) is the statement that we have equality throughout. So (2) holds if and only if The rest of the proof is elementary set theory: the intersection and union of a collection of sets agree if and only if there is only one set. More precisely, we have equality above if and only if there is only one associated prime.   is clear, given that every ideal has a minimal prime and minimal primes are always associated, so having a single associated prime means having only one minimal prime and no embedded primes.   : Given the observation that the radical of a primary ideal is prime, this is just a rewording of the definition.   : By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Lemma - Localization Ideals|Lemma]], we have the following characterization: Thus the second condition in is equivalent to .    Radical Max Implies Primary   Let be a noetherian ring and be an ideal. If a maximal ideal, then is a primary ideal.    By [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Support and Associated Primes|Theorem]], is nonempty and contained in , so , and hence by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Characterization of Primary Ideals|Proposition]] is primary.     Note that the assumption that is maximal was necessary here. Indeed, having a prime radical does not guarantee an ideal is primary, as we saw [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Exercise - Not Primary in |here]]. Moreover, even the powers of a prime ideal may fail to be primary.   Powers of Prime not Primary   Fix a field and an integer , and let . Consider the prime ideal in . On the one hand, , while and . Therefore, is not primary, even though its radical is the prime .    Contraction of Primary Ideals is Primary   Let be a ring homomorphism. If is a primary ideal in , then is a primary ideal in .    if , and , then , so for some . Therefore, , and is indeed primary.    Ass Intersection   If are ideals, then     The canonical map sending has kernel , so there is an inclusion . Hence, by and , The statement for larger follows by an easy induction.    Intersections Primary   A finite intersection of -primary ideals is -primary.    Let be -primary ideals. Then by , On the other hand, By , is nonempty, and thus . Then is -primary by the characterization of primary in (3) above.    Primary Decomposition   A primary decomposition primary decompostion irredundant primary decompostion of an ideal is an expression of the form with each primary. A primary decomposition is irredundant if      By , the intersection of -primary ideals is -primary. Thus we can turn any primary decomposition into an irredundant one by combining the terms with the same radical, then removing redundant terms.   Primary decomposition in  Given a decomposition of as a product of distinct primes, say , then the primary decomposition of the ideal is . However, this example can be deceiving, in that it suggests that primary ideals are just powers of primes; as we saw in , powers of primes may fail to be primary! Moreover, an ideal might be primary but not a power of a prime.    The existence of primary decompositions was first shown by Emanuel Lasker (yes, the chess champion!) for polynomial rings and power series rings in 1905, and then extended to any noetherian ring (which were not called that yet at the time) by Emmy Noether in 1921.   Lasker, 1905, Noether, 1921   Every ideal in a noetherian ring admits a primary decomposition.    We will say that an ideal is irreducible irreducible ideal if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of larger ideals. If is noetherian, we claim that any ideal of can be expressed as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. If the set of ideals that are not a finite intersection of irreducibles were nonempty, then by noetherianity there would be an ideal maximal with the property of not being an intersection of irreducible ideals. Such a maximal element must be an intersection of two larger ideals, each of which are finite intersections of irreducibles, giving a contradiction.  We claim that every irreducible ideal is primary. If we show this, any decomposition into an intersection of irreducible ideals will be a primary decomposition. To prove the contrapositive, suppose that is not primary, and take with , . The ascending chain of ideals stabilizes for some , since is moetherian. Note that this means that for any element , we have . Using this, we will show that proving that is not irreducible. The containment is clear. On the other hand, if we can write for some , and So By definition, this means that , and thus . This shows that is not irreducible, concluding the proof.    Irredundant Decompositions for   Let , where is a field, and . We can write These are two different irredundant primary decompositions of .    To check this, we just need to see that each of the ideals and are primary. Observe that each has radical , which is maximal, so these ideals are both primary. In fact, our ideal has infinitely many minimal primary decompositions: given any , is an irredundant primary decomposition. One thing all of these have in common is the radicals of the primary components: they are always and .    1st Uniqueness Theorem for Primary Decompositions   Suppose is an ideal in a noetherian ring . Given any irredundant primary decomposition of , say we have In particular, this set is the same for all irredundant primary decompositions of .    For any primary decomposition, irredundant or not, by we have We just need to show that in an irredundant decomposition as above, every is indeed an associated prime of . So fix , and let Since the decomposition is irredundant, the module is nonzero. By , has an associated prime, say . Fix such that is the annihilator of in for some . Since we conclude that . Since is the unique minimal prime of and is a prime containing , we must have . On the other hand, for any , we have , and since , we must have by the definition of primary ideal. Thus , so we can now conclude that . This shows that is an associated prime of for all . But this is a submodule of , and thus is associated to .     2nd Uniqueness Theorem for Primary Decompositions   If is an ideal in a noetherian ring , then the minimal components in any irredundant primary decomposition of are unique. More precisely, if is an irredundant primary decomposition, and , then is given by the formula which does not depend on our choice of irredundant decomposition.    Let be a primary ideal, and let be any prime. If , then . Since the associated primes of an ideal localize well, by , will still have a unique associated prime. Thus, the localization is either: - the unit ideal, if , or - a primary ideal, if . Finite intersections commute with localization, by , so for any prime , is a primary decomposition, although not necessarily irredundant. Fix a minimal prime of , and let . When we localize at , all the other components become the unit ideal, since their radicals are not contained in , and thus . We can then contract to to get , since is -primary and we can then apply (6).     If is not noetherian, we may or may not have a primary decomposition for a given ideal. It is true that if an ideal in a general ring has a primary decomposition, then the primes occurring are the same in any irredundant decomposition. However, they are not the associated primes of in general; rather, they are the primes that occur as radicals of annihilators of elements.   Decomposition of Radical Ideal is Unique  If is noetherian, and is a radical ideal, then we have seen that coincides with the intersection of its minimal primes , meaning . This is the only primary decomposition of a radical ideal.  For a more concrete example, take the ideal in . This ideal is radical, so we just need to find its minimal primes. And indeed, one can check that . More generally, the radical monomial ideals are precisely those that are squarefree, and the primary components of a monomial ideal are also monomial.   Decomposition of in Unique  Let's get back to our motivating example in , where some elements can be written as products of irreducible elements in more than one way. For example, we saw that So , but while is primary, is not. In fact, has two distinct minimal primes, and the following is a minimal primary decomposition for : In fact, all of these come components are minimal, and so this primary decomposition is unique. Primary decomposition saves the day!   Symbolic Power   If is a prime ideal in a ring , the  symbolic power symbolic power of is .    Characterizations of Symbolic Powers   Let be noetherian, and a prime ideal of . (a) . (b) is the unique smallest -primary ideal containing . (c) is the -primary component in any minimal primary decomposition of .    The first characterization follows from the definition, and the fact that expanding and contraction to\/from a localization is equivalent to saturating with respect to the multiplicative set, which we proved in .  We know that is -primary from one of the characterizations of primary we gave in . Any -primary ideal satisfies , and if , then . Thus, is the unique smallest -primary ideal containing .  The last characterization follows from the second uniqueness theorem, .      In , the prime satisfies for all . This follows along the same lines as .  In , where , we have seen in Example that the square of is not primary, and therefore . Indeed, , and , so but .  Let be a matrix of indeterminates, and be a polynomial ring over a field~ . Let be the ideal generated by minors of . Write for the determinant of the submatrix with rows and columns . We find Note that in the second row, we subtracted the Laplace expansion of the determinant of the matrix with row 3 replaced by another copy of row 1. That is, we subtracted zero.     While we will not discuss symbolic powers in detail, they are ubiquitous in commutative algebra. They show up as tools to prove various important theorems of different flavors, and they are also interesting objects in their own right. In particular, symbolic powers can be interpreted from a geometric perspective, via the Zariski-Nagata Theorem. Roughly, this theorem says that when we consider symbolic powers of prime ideals over , the polynomials in are precisely the polynomials that vanish on the variety corresponding to . This result can be made sense of more generally, for any radical ideal in over any perfect field , and even when .   "

Billy Crystal    We will now spend a while discussing the notion of dimension of a ring and dimension of a variety. To motivate the definition, let's first think in terms of varieties.  We take our inspiration from the fundamental setting of dimension theory: vector spaces. The notion of basis doesn't make sense for varieties (What does it mean to span? Where is zero?), but one relevant thing we do have for both vector spaces and for varieties is subobjects.  One way to characterize the dimension of a vector space is the the largest number such that there is a proper chain of subspaces We can try something similar for varieties, but for a reducible variety, this is not a very good notion. For example, for a union of points, we can cook up a chain of proper subvarieties by adding one more point each time, but a point should be zero-dimensional by any reasonable measure. So, if we want this approach to work, we should stick to chains of irreducible subvarieties.   Dimension of Variety   The dimension dimension of a variety of an affine variety is defined as     Krull Dimension of a Ring   The Krull dimension Krull dimension dimension of a ring is We often call it simply the dimension of . Alternatively, is the supremum of the lengths of saturated chains of primes of .  FIX    Dimension of a Module   The dimension dimension of a module of an -module is defined as .    Dimension of Field is Zero  The dimension of any field is zero.   Equivalent Zero Dimensional Ring Definition  A ring is zero-dimensional if and only if every minimal prime of is a maximal ideal.   Dimension of PIDs not Fields is  The ring of integers has dimension , since there is one minimal prime and every other prime is maximal. Likewise, any PID that is not a field has dimension one.   UFD height 1   Let be a ring and be an ideal in . If is a UFD, is a prime of height one if and only if for a prime element .    If with irreducible, and , then contains some nonzero multiple of , say with and coprime. Since , , so we must have , so . Thus, has height one. On the other hand, if is a prime of height one, we claim contains an irreducible element. Indeed, is nonzero, so contains some , and primeness implies one of the prime factors of is contained in . Thus, any nonzero prime contains a prime ideal of the form , so a height one prime must be of this form.    Dim of is Zero  For a field , the ring is not noetherian, as is an infinite ascending chain, so is not noetherian. However, is a maximal ideal, and hence is the unique minimal prime of , which is also maximal. Therefore, .   Nagata  Let be a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables, which we are thinking of as arranged in an infinite triangle. is clearly infinite-dimensional and not noetherian. Let and . Note that is an intersection of multiplicatively closed subsets, so this is a valid localization of .  For any , we have a chain of primes in . As these primes are all contained in , none of these intersects , so the expansion to of the chain above yields a proper chain of primes in . It follows that for all , so is infinite-dimensional.  It turns out that is noetherian, which is not at all obvious and a bit technical, so we will not prove it.   Properties of Dimension and Height   Let be a ring. (a) A prime has height zero if and only if it is a minimal prime of . (b) An ideal has height zero if and only if it is contained in a minimal prime of . In particular, in a domain, every nonzero ideal has positive height. (c) . (d) . (e) If is an ideal, then . (f) If is prime, (g) If is an ideal, (h) If is a multiplicative set, then . (i) If is prime, then . (j) If are primes, then is the supremum of the lengths of saturated chains of primes in of the form .    We will prove some of these and leave the rest as an exercise.  A prime has height if and only if it contains no other prime, which is equivalent being a minimal prime of .  If is contained in a minimal prime of , then by (1), so by definition. Conversely, if , by definition, there is a minimal prime of of height , so some minimal prime of is a minimal prime of , so is contained in a minimal prime of .  It suffices to show that if and then . By definition, means that there is a chain of primes By (5), means that there is a chain of primes with . We can assume without loss of generality that , since if not, we can add it to the bottom of the chain. Putting these chains together, we get a chain of length in , so .  Let and . The inequality means that for every minimal prime of , . The inequality implies that there exists a minimal prime of of such that . For such a minimal prime as in the latter statement, using (5), we get the desired conclusion.     We know that in noetherian rings, there can be arbitrarily long chains of primes, since the dimension can be infinite as in Nagata's . On the other hand, any ascending proper chain of primes is finite, as a consequence of the definition. Does this imply that every prime has finite height? This does not prevent that possibility that there could be an infinite descending chain of primes, which would then give any of the primes in the chain infinite height. (This seems strange in conjunction with the fact that in any ring, any prime contains a minimal prime, but it does not contradict this.) Another possible problem is there being two primes such that for all there exists a chain of primes of length from to .  However, we will later show that the height of any ideal in a noetherian ring is finite.   Int Extension of Domains Nonzero Multiple  Let be an integral extension of domains. Show that every nonzero has a nonzero multiple in , meaning that there exists such that and .    Let be an infinite field and . We have shown that and that is the coordinate ring of the curve As is a curve (meaning it is parameterized by a single parameter), we should expect the dimension of the variety , and equivalently of the ring , to be . Let's prove this.  On the one hand, is a domain, so is the unique minimal prime. To show that , we need to show that any nonzero prime ideal is maximal.  Set . We note that does not satisfy any algebraic relation over , so is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable, where that one variable corresponds to . Moreover, note that the inclusion is integral, since satisfies the monic polynomial and satisfies the monic polynomial . Polynomial rings in one variable have dimension , so .  Let be nonzero. Note first that , since if , then there is some nonzero multiple of in by . Since , is maximal. The inclusion is integral: a dependence relation for any representative yields a dependence relation. Since is a field, is a domain, and the inclusion is integral, by we can conclude that is a field, so is a maximal ideal. This shows that every nonzero prime in is maximal, and thus .   Catenary Ring   A ring is catenary caternary ring if for every pair of primes , every saturated chain of primes has the same length.    Equidimensional Ring   A ring is equidimensional equidimensional ring if every maximal ideal has the same finite height, and every minimal prime has the same dimension.     Consider the ring We can find the minimal primes of by computing in . The prime ideals and are incomparable, and , so . We claim that the height of is one: it contains the minimal prime , and any saturated chain from to corresponds to a saturated chain from to in , which must have length 1 since this is a PID. The height of is at least 2, as witnessed by the chain . So is not equidimensional.    The ring is a domain that is not equidimensional. On the one hand, the maximal ideal has height at least two, which we see from the chain Thus . On the other hand, we will show later that the prime ideal has height 1, and it is maximal since . Therefore, , and thus whereas . %In fact, , but I won't justify this.  The ring in this example is in fact a catenary domain, which we will not justify. Notice that there are maximal ideals of distinct heights in this ring, for example the ideal given above is a prime of height 1 whereas and the maximal ideal has height 2. Thus this ring is not equidimensional.   "

Shaun White    In this section, we will collect theorems about the spectrum of a ring: theorems that assert that the map on Spec is surjective, and theorems about lifting chains of primes.

For the second map, , we saw in that the map on spectra can be identified with the inclusion of the set of primes that do not intersect , i.e., those whose contraction is contained in . Therefore, is injective, since it is the composition of two injective maps.  On the one hand, if a prime contains , then . If moreover , we must have .

For any , if and only if     If , then so localizing at , we get an inclusion . Since is nonzero, so is and thus its spectrum is nonempty. By , there is a prime mapping to .  If , then .

Notice that , but not in , so , and thus . We can check this more directly, by noting that any prime in contracting to would contain , so or . But and , so no prime in contracts to .   Direct Summand and Surj Spec Map   If is a direct summand, the map is surjective.    By , we know for all ideals in this case, so says the map on Spec is surjective.

An element of is integral integral over an ideal over if it satisfies an equation of the form An element of is integral over if In both cases, we say that and satisfy an equation of integral dependence over   FIX integral closure of an ideal     Notice that is immediate from the definition.   Rees Algebra  Let , be an ideal of , and be an indeterminate. Consider the rings Here is the subalgebra of generated by elements of the form for all .

Extension-Contraction Lemma for Int. Ext.   Let be integral, and be an ideal of . Then , and hence .    Let . We can write for some . Moreover, taking , we also have . We will show that , so follows as a corollary. So we might as well replace with , so that is also integral and module-finite. By , the extension is also module-finite.  Let . We can write with . We can write these equations in the form , where , and . By the determinantal trick, , we have . Since we can assume , we have . The fact that this is the type of equation we want follows from the monomial expansion of the determinant: any monomial is a product of terms where some of them are copies of , and the rest are elements of . Since this is a product of terms, a term in has a coefficient coming from a product of elements of .  So this shows that . Now notice that is immediate from the definition, as noted in .    Lying Over  Lying Over Theorem   If is an integral extension, then for every , and the induced map is surjective.    Let be any ideal in . Given any , we have for some and some for all , so Thus . Therefore, if is a prime in , by we have , and Then , and by we conclude that is in the image of the map on Spec.     Both assumptions that the extension is integral and that it is an inclusion are needed in [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Lying Over|Lying Over]]; we cannot reduce to the case of an integral inclusion. The point is that being an inclusion does not translate into a property of the induced map on Spec.    We saw in that the map induced on Spec by the inclusion is not surjective. So does not apply ‚Äî indeed, this inclusion is not module-finite, and thus by it is not integral. For example, the infinite set is a minimal generating set for over .    Suppose is a regular element on , but not a unit. Since is regular, the map is an inclusion, but we claim it is not integral. If is integral over , there would be such that After multiplying by all terms are of the form , and thus in , since the localization map is injective. So and must be a unit. So whenever is a regular element but not a unit, is an example of an inclusion that is not integral. Note that the image of the map on Spec is the complement of , so in particular the map is not surjective.  In contrast, the map is integral, since it is module-finite, but it is not an inclusion. The map on Spec is again not surjective: its image is .    Let be an ideal in . Suppose is an integral extension. There is an induced map , and that map is integral: an equation of integral dependance for over gives an equation for integral dependance of its class in over .   Integral Extension Maximal Contracts to Maximal   If is integral, is maximal if and only if is maximal in .    By , the induced map is an integral extension of domains, and (respectively, ) is maximal if and only if (respectively, ) is a field. So this follows by .    Integral Preserved by Localization   Let be integral, and let be a multiplicatively closed subset of . Then is integral.    Since is a multiplicatively closed subset of , its image in is also multiplicatively closed. Given and , then we have equations of the form Thus is integral over , and is integral over .    Incomparability  Incomparability   If is integral and are primes in that satisfy , then .    In this case we can reduce to the case of an inclusion: factors through , and the map induced on Spec factors as Since the map on spectra induced by is injective, we can replace by the quotient and assume is an integral inclusion.  So suppose is integral, and let . By , localizing at preserves integrality. %We claim that localizing at preserves integrality: if and , then we have equations of the form  By localizing at , the image of is a maximal ideal. So we can reduce to the situation where is a maximal ideal. By , are both maximal ideals. Therefore, .    Finite Contractions in Int Noeth Alg   Let be an integral -algebra. If is noetherian, then only finitely many primes contract to each .    If contracts to , then , so in particular contains some prime minimal over . Then so . By , . So all the primes contracting to are in , which is a finite set since is noetherian, by .    Integral Dim Inequality   If is integral, then for any we have In particular, .    Given a chain of primes in , we can contract to , and by we get a chain of distinct primes in .    Going Up  Going Up Theorem   If is integral, then for every in and with , there is some with and .    Consider the map . This is integral, as we observed in . It is also injective, so applies. Thus, there is a prime of that contracts to the prime in . We can write for some , and we must have that contracts to .    Integral Dim Equality   If is integral, then .    We have already shown that in , so we just need to show that . Fix a chain of primes in . By Lying Over, , there is a prime contracting to . Then by Going up, , we have with . Continuing, we can build a chain of distinct primes in of length . So , and equality follows.    Lemma Minimal Polynomial   Let be a integrally closed and let be an element in some larger domain that is integral over . Let be the fraction field of , and be the minimal polynomial of over . (a) If is integral over , then . (b) If is integral over a prime , then has all of its nonleading coefficients in .    Let be integral over . Fix an algebraic closure of containing , and let , be the roots of . Since divides any polynomial with coefficients in that satisfies, it also divides a monic equation of integral dependance for over . Therefore, each is a solution to such an equation of integral dependence, and thus must be integral over .  Let . This is a module-finite extension of , so all of its elements are integral over . The leading coefficient of is 1, and the remaining coefficients of are polynomials in the , hence they lie in . On the other hand, is normal, so . We conclude that all the coefficients of are in , and .  Now let be integral over . By the same argument as above, all of the are integral over . Since each , any polynomial in the lies in . So the nonleading coefficients of lie in , by [[Mathematics\/Commutative Algebra\/Results\/Theorem - Lying Over|Lying Over]].    Going Down  Going Down Theorem   Suppose that is a integrally closed, is a domain, and is integral. Then, for every in and in with , there is some with and .    Let be the multiplicative set in consisting of products of elements in and . Note that each of the sets and contains , so and are both contained in . We will show that is empty. Once we do that, it will follow from that there is a prime ideal in containing such that is empty. Since , our new prime must necessarily be contained in .  Moreover, , so is empty, or equivalently, . Since and , we conclude that .  So our goal is to show that is empty. We proceed by contradiction, and assume there is some . We can write for some and . Moreover, since , is integral over , by .  Consider the minimal polynomial of over , say By , each . Then substituting in and dividing by yields We claim that this is the minimal polynomial of . If satisfied a monic polynomial of degree , multiplying by would give us a polynomial of degree that satisfies, which is impossible. So indeed, this is the minimal polynomial of .  Since , and thus integral over , says that each . Since and , we must have . The equation then shows that . Since contains and hence , we have . This is the desired contradiction, since by construction.    Height in Normal Domains   If is a integrally closed, is a domain, and is integral, then for any .    We already know from that . To show that , given a saturated chain up to , we can apply to get a chain just as long that goes up to .    "

Let be a homogeneous polynomial of degree . There is a degree-preserving -algebra automorphism of given by for and that maps to a polynomial that viewed as a polynomial in with coefficients in , has leading term for some (nonzero) .    Given , we just need to show that the coefficient of is nonzero for some choice of . One can check that the coefficient of the term is .

In particular, if is a field and is a finitely generated -algebra, then there exist algebraically independent over such that is module-finite.

Noether Normalization Height and Dimension   Let be a domain that is a finitely generated algebra over a field , or a quotient of a power series ring over a field. Let be any noether normalization for . For any maximal ideal of , the length of any saturated chain of primes from to is . In particular, .    We will show the proof in the case when is a finitely generated domain over a field ; the power series case is similar, and left as an exercise. We will prove by induction on~ that for any finitely generated domain with a Noether normalization with algebraically independent elements, any saturated chain of primes ending in a maximal ideal has length~ .  When , is a domain that is integral over a field, hence is a field by . Now suppose the statement holds for , and let be a finitely generated domain over some field with Noether normalization . Consider a maximal ideal of and a saturated chain By , its contraction to is a chain of distinct primes in : Our assumption that the original chain is saturated implies that has height 1. Suppose that had height or more. By , we would be able to construct a chain up to $Q_1 $ of length or more, but has height . Thus has height . Since is a UFD, for some prime element , by . After a change of variables, as in , we can assume that is monic in with coefficients in . So are module-finite extensions, and the induction hypothesis applies to . Now is a saturated chain in the domain going up to the maximal ideal . The induction hypothesis then says that this chain has length , so , and .    Dimension of Polynomial Ring   The dimension of the polynomial ring is .    The polynomial ring is a Noether normalization of itself, so says that it must have dimension .    Dimension of Algebra   If is a -algebra, the dimension of is less than or equal to the minimal size of an algebra generating set for over . If and , then is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over , and the generators are algebraically independent.    The first statement is trivial unless is finitely generated, in which case we can write for some ideal , so Suppose we chose to be minimal. If , then , since the zero ideal is not contained in .    F.G. Algebra Catenary Domain   Let be a finitely generated algebra or a quotient of a power series ring over a field. (a) is catenary. If additionally is a domain, then (b) is equidimensional, and (c) for all ideals .    Let be primes in . After quotient out by , we can assume that is a domain and . Fix a saturated chain from to a maximal ideal . Given two saturated chains , from to , the concatenations and are saturated chains from to , so by they must have the same length. It follows that and have the same length.  Equidimensionality is immediate from .  We have and Therefore, it suffices to show the equality for prime ideals, since if attains , which is the minimal value of for , then it also attains the maximal value of for .

Transcendence Basis   Let be an extension of fields. A transcendence basis transcendence basis for over is a maximal algebraically independent subset of over .    Transcendence Basis Well-Defined 1   Let and be two transcendence bases for over . Then, there is some such that is a transcendence basis.    Since is algebraic over , for each there is some such that . We can clear denominators to assume without loss of generality that .  We claim that there is some such that . If not, then for all , and thus that each is algebraic over . Thus, is algebraic over , and since is algebraic over , is algebraic over , which contradicts that is a transcendence basis. This shows the claim.  Now, we claim that for such , is a transcendence basis. Thinking of the equation as a polynomial expression in , is algebraic over , hence is algebraic over , and as well.  If were algebraically dependent, then there is some polynomial equation . This equation must involve , since are algebraically independent. We would then have is algebraic over . But since is algebraic over , we would have that is algebraic over , which would contradict that is a transcendence basis.

Let us use our dimension theorems to give two different proofs that over any field , has dimension 2.  First, we claim that is a Noether normalization of . First, note that and are algebraically independent over . Moreover, and satisfies the monic polynomial , so is integral, and thus module-finite by . Therefore, .

Then is a prime of height one, so by the dimension of is     Let us compute the dimension of the ring , where We claim that is a Noether normalization. The inclusion is integral, since so satisfies . Similarly, one can show that satisfies . so satisfies .  We also need to show that are algebraically independent over , or equivalently that the map from the polynomial ring with , is injective.  First assume that is algebraically closed. Observe that the map #empty  is surjective: given , write , and note that is an element of that maps to . Thus, the kernel of the induced map on coordinate rings is ; i.e, the map is injective. By the Nullstellensatz, , and our induced map on coordinate rings is the map #empty Since this map is injective, and this factors as #empty the first map is injective.   "

There also branches of algebra where rings are allowed to not have a multiplicative identity; we recommend for an excellent read on the topic of Why rings should have a 1 .

  "body": "Getting Started  A Macaulay2 session often starts with defining some ambient ring we will be doing computations over. Common rings such as the rationals and the integers can be defined using the commands QQ and ZZ ; one can easily take quotients or build polynomial rings (in finitely many variables) over these. For example,  i1 : R = ZZ\/101[x,y] o1 = R o1 : PolynomialRing and i1 : k = ZZ\/101; i2 : R = k[x,y];  both store the ring as , with the small difference that in the second example Macaulay2 has named the coefficient field . One quirk that might make a difference later is that if we use the first option and later set to be the field , our ring is not a polynomial ring over . Also, in the second example we ended each line with a ; , which tells Macaulay2 to run the command but not display the result of the computation ‚Äî which is in this case was simply an assignment, so the result is not relevant.  We can now do all sorts of computations over our ring . For example, we can define an ideal in as follows:  i3 : I = ideal(x^2,y^2,x*y) 2 2 o3 = ideal (x , y , x*y) o3 : Ideal of R  Above we have set to be the ideal in that is generated by . The notation ideal( ) requires the usage of ^ for powers and * for products; alternatively, we can define the exact same ideal with the notation ideal\" \" , as follows:  i3 : I = ideal\"x2,y2,xy\" 2 2 o3 = ideal (x , y , x*y) o3 : Ideal of R  Now we can use this ideal to either define a quotient ring or the -module , as follows:  i4 : M = R^1\/I o4 = cokernel | x2 y2 xy | 1 o4 : R-module, quotient of R i5 : S = R\/I o5 = S o5 : QuotientRing  It's important to note that while is a ring, is the -module ‚Äî this is a very important difference for Macaulay2, since these two objects have different types. So defined above is a ring, while is a module. Notice that Macaulay2 stored the module as the cokernel of the map   When you make a new definition in Macaulay2, you might want to pay attention to what ring your new object is defined over. For example, now that we defined this ring , Macaulay2 has automatically taken to be our current ambient ring, and any calculation or definition we run next will be considered over and not . If you want to return to the original ring , you must first run the command use R   If you want to work over a finitely generated algebra over one of the basic rings you can define in Macaulay2, and your ring is not a quotient of a polynomial ring, you want to rewrite this algebra as a quotient of a polynomial ring. For example, suppose you want to work over the second Veronese in variables over our field from before, meaning the algebra . We need algebra generators, which we will call corresponding to and :  o6 = U o6 : PolynomialRing i7 : f = map(R,U,{x^2,x*y,y^2}) 2 2 o7 = map(R,U,{x , x*y, y }) o7 : RingMap R <--- U i8 : J = ker f 2 o8 = ideal(b - a*c) o8 : Ideal of U i9 : T = U\/J o9 = T o9 : QuotientRing  Our ring at the end is isomorphic to the 2nd Veronese of , which is the ring we wanted. Note the syntax order in map : first target, then source, then a list with the images of each algebra generator.  "

  "body": "Basic Commands  Many Macaulay2 commands are easy to guess, and named exactly what you would expect them to be named. Often, googling ‚ÄúMacaulay2‚Äù followed by a few descriptive words will easily land you on the documentation for whatever you are trying to do.  Here are some basic commands you will likely use:    ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) will return the ideal generated by . Here products should be indicated by * , and powers with ^ . If you'd rather not use ^ (this might be nice if you have lots of powers), you can write ideal (f_1, \\dots , f_n) instead.     map S, R, (f_1, \\dots , f_n) gives a ring map if and are rings, and is a quotient of . The resulting ring map will send . There are many variations of map ‚Äî for example, you can use it to define -module homomorphisms ‚Äî but you should carefully input the information in the required format. Try viewHelp map in Macaulay2 for more details.     ker returns the kernel of the map .     I + J and I*J return the sum and product of the ideals and , respectively.     A = matrix\\{\\{a_1,1, \\dots , a_1,n}, \\dots , {a_m,1, \\dots , a_m,n\\}\\} returns the matrix      As in most programming languages, Macaulay2 follows the convention that the first position in a list is the th position.  The method primaryDecomposition returns a list of primary ideals whose intersection is the input ideal, and associatedPrimes returns the list of associated primes of the given ideal or module. Operations on lists are often intuitive. For example, let's say we want to find the primary component of an ideal with a particular radical.  i1 : R = QQ[x,y]; i2 : I = ideal\"x2,xy\"; o2 : Ideal of R i3 : prim = primaryDecomposition I 2 o3 = {ideal x, ideal (y, x )} o3 : List i4 : L = select(prim, Q -> radical(Q) == ideal\"x,y\") 2 o4 = {ideal (y, x )} o4 : List  The method select returns a list of all the elements in our list with the required properties. In this case, if we actually want the primary ideal we just selected, as opposed to a list containing it, we need to extract the first component of our list .  i5 : L_0 2 o5 = ideal (y, x ) o5 : Ideal of R  "
