<div class="para">There are several computer algebra systems dedicated to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra computations, such as Singular (more popular among algebraic geometers), CoCoA (which is more popular with european commutative algebraists, having originated in Genova, Italy), and Macaulay2. There are many computations you could run on any of these systems (and others), but we will focus on Macaulay2 since it's the most popular computer algebra system among US based commutative algebraists.</div>
