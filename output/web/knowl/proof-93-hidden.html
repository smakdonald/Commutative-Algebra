<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">We will say that an ideal is irreducible  if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of larger ideals. If <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is noetherian, we claim that any ideal of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> can be expressed as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. If the set of ideals that are not a finite intersection of irreducibles were nonempty, then by noetherianity there would be an ideal maximal with the property of not being an intersection of irreducible ideals. Such a maximal element must be an intersection of two larger ideals, each of which are finite intersections of irreducibles, giving a contradiction.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We claim that every irreducible ideal is primary. If we show this, any decomposition into an intersection of irreducible ideals will be a primary decomposition. To prove the contrapositive, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is not primary, and take <span class="process-math">\(xy\in Q\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x\notin Q\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\notin \sqrt{Q}\text{.}\)</span> The ascending chain of ideals</div>
