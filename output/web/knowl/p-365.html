<div class="para">We will now discuss an important lemma known as Prime Avoidance. This is an elementary fact, but it is very helpful. Prime Avoidance says that if an ideal <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is not contained in any of the primes <span class="process-math">\(P_1, \ldots, P_n\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> cannot be contained in their union. Set-theoretically this is possible, of course; but if the ideals <span class="process-math">\(P_1, \ldots, P_n\)</span> are all prime, then it is actually not possible for <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq P_1 \cup \cdots \cup P_n\)</span> unless <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is contained in one of the <span class="process-math">\(P_i\text{.}\)</span> In fact, for this to work we can even allow two of the <span class="process-math">\(P_i\)</span> to be just any ideals, as long as the remaining <span class="process-math">\(P_i\)</span> are prime.</div>
