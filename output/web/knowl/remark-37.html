<div class="para">We will now show a very simple but extremely useful result known as Nakayama's Lemma. Nakayama himself claimed that this should be attributed to Krull and Azumaya, but it's not clear which of the three actually had the commutative ring statement first. So some authors (e.g., Matsumura) prefer to refer to it as NAK. There are actually a range of statements, rather than just one, that go under the banner of Nakayama's Lemma a.k.a. NAK.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-nak.html#remark-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
