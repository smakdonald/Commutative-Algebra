<div class="para">There are many interesting examples of <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span>-graded algebras with <span class="process-math">\(R_0 = k\text{;}\)</span> in that case, <span class="process-math">\(R_+\)</span> is the largest homogeneous ideal in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> In fact, <span class="process-math">\(R_0\)</span> is the only maximal ideal of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> that is also homogeneous, so we can call it  {}; it is sometimes also called the {} of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> This ideal plays a very important role: in many ways, <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_+\)</span> behave similarly to a local ring <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and its unique maximal ideal. We will discuss this further when we learn about local rings.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-finite-conditions-graded-algebras.html#remark-20" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
