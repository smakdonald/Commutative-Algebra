<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be an uncountable algebraically closed field and <span class="process-math">\(\fm\)</span> be any maximal ideal in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(L := R/\fm \not\cong k\text{.}\)</span> Then there exists some element <span class="process-math">\(\alpha \in L\)</span> that is transcendental over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is an extension of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Now consider the set</div>

S = \left\lbrace \frac{1}{\alpha-c} \mid c \in k \right\rbrace.

<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly dependent set over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> then we can find finitely many <span class="process-math">\(b_1, \ldots, b_n, c_1, \ldots, c_n \in k\)</span> such that</div>

<div class="para">Rewriting the left side as one fraction, the numerator is a polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is transcendental over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly independent set. But <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is uncountable, so <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is uncountable, and that means that <span class="process-math">\(\dim_k(L)\)</span> is uncountable. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is by construction algebra-finite over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a field, being algebra-finite and module-finite over <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> are equivalent conditions, and thus <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> should be a finite dimensional vector space over~<span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This is a contradiction, so we cannot have any transcendental element over <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(k = L\text{.}\)</span>
