<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field, and let <span class="process-math">\(s \in S\)</span> be a nonzero element, which is necessarily integral over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> The ring <span class="process-math">\(R[s]\)</span> is algebra-finite over <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> by construction, and integral over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(R \subseteq R[s]\)</span> is integral and algebra-finite, it must also be module-finite. Since <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is a field, this means that <span class="process-math">\(R[s]\)</span> is a finite-dimensional vector space over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(R[s] \subseteq S\)</span> is a domain, the map <span class="process-math">\(R[s] \xrightarrow{\, s \,} R[s]\)</span> is injective. Notice that this is a map of finite-dimensional <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-vector spaces, and thus it must also be surjective. In particular, there exists an element <span class="process-math">\(t \in R[s]\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(st = 1,\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is invertible. We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> must be a field.</div>
