<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(W=(S \setminus Q')(R \setminus P)\)</span> be the multiplicative set in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> consisting of products of elements in <span class="process-math">\(S \setminus Q'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R \setminus P\text{.}\)</span> Note that each of the sets <span class="process-math">\(S \setminus Q'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R \setminus P\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(S \setminus Q'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R \setminus P\)</span> are both contained in <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(W \cap P S\)</span> is empty. Once we do that, it will follow from  that there is a prime ideal <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(P S\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(W \cap Q\)</span> is empty.

</div> <div class="para">Moreover, <span class="process-math">\(R \setminus P \subseteq W\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\((Q \cap R) \cap (R \setminus P)\)</span> is empty, or equivalently, <span class="process-math">\(Q \cap R \subseteq P\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(Q \cap R \subseteq P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q \cap R \supseteq P\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(Q \cap R = P\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">We claim that this is the minimal polynomial of <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> satisfied a monic polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(d &lt; n\text{,}\)</span> multiplying by <span class="process-math">\(r^d\)</span> would give us a polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies, which is impossible.
