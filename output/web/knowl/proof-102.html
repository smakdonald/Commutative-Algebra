<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(x\in IS\text{.}\)</span> We can write <span class="process-math">\(x = a_1 s_1 + \cdots + a_t s_t\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(a_i\in I\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, taking <span class="process-math">\(S'=R[s_1,\dots,s_t]\text{,}\)</span> we also have <span class="process-math">\(x\in IS'\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(x \in \overline{I}^{S'}\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x \in \overline{I}^{S}\)</span> follows as a corollary. So we might as well replace <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(S'\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(R \subseteq S\)</span> is also integral and module-finite. By , the extension is also module-finite.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(S= R b_1 + \cdots + R b_n\text{.}\)</span> We can write</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x b_i = \left(\sum_{k=1}^t a_k s_k \right) b_i = \sum_j a_{ij} b_j

<div class="para">with <span class="process-math">\(a_{ij}\in I\text{.}\)</span> We can write these equations in the form <span class="process-math">\(x v = Av\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(v=(b_1,\dots,b_u)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A=[a_{ij}]\text{.}\)</span> By the determinantal trick, , we have <span class="process-math">\(\det(xI-A)v=0\text{.}\)</span> Since we can assume <span class="process-math">\(b_1=1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\det(xI-A)=0\text{.}\)</span> The fact that this is the type of equation we want follows from the monomial expansion of the determinant: any monomial is a product of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms where some of them are copies of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and the rest are elements of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Since this is a product of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms, a term in <span class="process-math">\(x^i\)</span> has a coefficient coming from a product of <span class="process-math">\(n-i\)</span> elements of <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para">So this shows that <span class="process-math">\(IS \subseteq\overline{I}^S\text{.}\)</span> Now notice that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{I}^S \cap R = \overline{I}\)</span> is immediate from the definition, as noted in .</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-over-up-down.html#proof-102" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
