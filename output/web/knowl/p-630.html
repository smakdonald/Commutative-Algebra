<div class="para">We will say that an ideal is irreducible  if it cannot be written as a proper intersection of larger ideals. If <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is noetherian, we claim that any ideal of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> can be expressed as a finite intersection of irreducible ideals. If the set of ideals that are not a finite intersection of irreducibles were nonempty, then by noetherianity there would be an ideal maximal with the property of not being an intersection of irreducible ideals. Such a maximal element must be an intersection of two larger ideals, each of which are finite intersections of irreducibles, giving a contradiction.</div>
