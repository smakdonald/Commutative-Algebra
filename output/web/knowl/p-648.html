<div class="para">While we will not discuss symbolic powers in detail, they are ubiquitous in commutative algebra. They show up as tools to prove various important theorems of different flavors, and they are also interesting objects in their own right. In particular, symbolic powers can be interpreted from a geometric perspective, via the Zariski-Nagata Theorem. Roughly, this theorem says that when we consider symbolic powers of prime ideals over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_d]\text{,}\)</span> the polynomials in <span class="process-math">\(P^{(n)}\)</span> are precisely the polynomials that vanish  on the variety corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> This result can be made sense of more generally, for any radical ideal in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}[x_1, \ldots, x_d]\)</span> over any perfect field <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> and even when <span class="process-math">\(k = \mathbb{Z}\text{.}\)</span>
