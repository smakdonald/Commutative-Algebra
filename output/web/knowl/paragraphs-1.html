<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">            i1 : R = QQ[x,y,z];

            i2 : M = R^3 
                  3
            o2 = R

            o2 : R-module, free
</pre>
<div class="para">Note that from now on and until we reset Macaulay2, whenever you write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R</code> it will be read as a ring, not a module; if instead you want to refer to the module <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> you can write it as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R^1</code>. Alternatively, you can also use the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">module</code> and write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">module R</code>. If you do calculations that require a module and not a ring, it is important to be careful about whether you write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">R^1</code>; this is an easy way to get an error message.</div> <div class="para">If we want to define a module that happens to be an ideal, but we want to think about it as a module, we can use the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">module</code> to turn the ideal into a module:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">i3 : I = ideal"xy,yz"

o3 = ideal (x*y, y*z)

o3 : Ideal of R

i4 : N = module I

o4 = image | xy yz |
                              1
o4 : R-module, submodule of R
</pre>
<div class="para">If we forget that this is actually an ideal, and simply think about as a submodule of the module <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> we can also view this module as the image of a map, as we described in \Cref{remark modules quotients of Rn} <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: cite]</code>: if a submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^m\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> generators, we can view it as the the image of the map <span class="process-math">\(R^n \to R^m\)</span> that sends each of the canonical generators of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\)</span> to the generators we chose for our module. In our example, our module is the image of the following map from <span class="process-math">\(R^2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(R\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">i5 : phi = map(R^1,R^2,{{x*y,y*z}})

o5 = | xy yz |
              1       2
o5 : Matrix R  &lt;--- R

i6 : L = image phi

o6 = image | xy yz |
                              1
o6 : R-module, submodule of R
</pre>
<div class="para">Note that above, when we first defined the module <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> Macaulay2 immediately stored that information in this exact way, as the image of the same map we just defined. This is useful to keep in mind when you see the results for a computation: if a module is given to us as the image of a matrix, then we are being told that our module is a submodule of some free module. If the matrix has <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> rows, then that means our module is a submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\text{.}\)</span> Each column corresponds to a generator of our module (as a submodule of <span class="process-math">\(R^n\)</span>).</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Of course that the modules <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(N\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> we have defined are all the same module: the ideal <span class="process-math">\((xy,yz)\text{.}\)</span> It is our job to know that; depending on how you ask the question, Macaulay2 might not be able to identify this. Finally, we can also describe this module by saying that it has two generators, say <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> and there is a unique relation between them:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
-zf + yg = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This means that our module is the quotient of <span class="process-math">\(R^2\)</span> by the submodule generated by the relation <span class="process-math">\((-z,y)\text{.}\)</span> We can write this as the quotient of <span class="process-math">\(R^2\)</span> by the image of a map landing in <span class="process-math">\(R^2\text{,}\)</span> meaning it is the cokernel of a map.</div>
</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">i7 : psi = map(R^2,R^1,{{-z},{y}})

o7 = | -z |
    | y  |
              2       1
o7 : Matrix R  &lt;--- R

i8 : K = coker psi

o8 = cokernel | -z |
              | y  |
                            2

</pre>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">When a module is given to us in this format, as the cokernel of some matrix, we are essentially being given a presentation: the number of rows is the number of generators, while each column corresponds to a relation among those generators. If one the vector <span class="process-math">\((r_1, \ldots, r_n)\)</span> appears in a column of the matrix, that means that the generators <span class="process-math">\(m_1, \ldots, m_n\)</span> satisfy the relation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/ch-local-rings.html">
\begin{equation*}
r_1 m_1 + \cdots + r_n m_n  = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Keep in mind that when you do a calculation and the result is a module given to you in this format, Macaulay2 will not necessarily respond with a <em class="emphasis">minimal</em> presentation: one of the generators given might actually be a linear combination of the remaining ones, so there might be more generators than necessary, and there might be superfluous relations which follow as linear combinations of the others. You might be able to get rid of some superfluous generators and relations using the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">prune</code>. We will discuss this in more detail when we talk about local rings in <a href="ch-local-rings.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Local Rings">ChapterÂ 5</a>.</div>
