<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be integral over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Fix an algebraic closure of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(x_1~=~x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x_2,\ldots,x_u\)</span> be the roots of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> divides any polynomial with coefficients in <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies, it also divides a monic equation of integral dependance for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, each <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> is a solution to such an equation of integral dependence, and thus must be integral over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(S=R[x_1,\dots,x_u] \subseteq \overline{k}\text{.}\)</span> This is a module-finite extension of <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> so all of its elements are integral over <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> The leading coefficient of <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> is 1, and the remaining coefficients of <span class="process-math">\(f(t)\)</span> are polynomials in the <span class="process-math">\(x_i\text{,}\)</span> hence they lie in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is normal, so <span class="process-math">\(S \cap k = R\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that all the coefficients of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f \in R[t]\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Now let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be integral over <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> By the same argument as above, all of the <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> are integral over <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Since each <span class="process-math">\(x_i \in \overline{P}^S\text{,}\)</span> any polynomial in the <span class="process-math">\(x_i\)</span> lies in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{P}^S\text{.}\)</span> So the nonleading coefficients of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> lie in <span class="process-math">\(\overline{P}^S \cap R = P\text{,}\)</span> by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[provisional cross-reference: cite]</code> [[Mathematics/Commutative Algebra/Results/Theorem - Lying Over|Lying Over]].</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-over-up-down.html#proof-104" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
