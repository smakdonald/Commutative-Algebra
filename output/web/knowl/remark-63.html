<div class="para">Power series rings <span class="process-math">\(k \llbracket x_1, \ldots, x_d \rrbracket\)</span> are regular local rings. In general, a ring is regular if all its localizations are regular local rings. In order for this definition to make sense, we need to first make sure that regularity localizes, meaning that if <span class="process-math">\((R, \fm)\)</span> is a regular local ring, then <span class="process-math">\(R_P\)</span> is also regular for all primes <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> But to do that, we need some homological algebra. However (spoiler alert!), things do work out alright, and as you might expect, polynomial rings over fields are also regular.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-height-generators.html#remark-63" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
