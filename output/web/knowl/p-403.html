<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is an <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span>-graded <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-algebra with <span class="process-math">\(R_0 = k\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\fm = \bigoplus_{n &gt; 0} R_0\)</span> is the homogeneous maximal ideal, <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\fm\)</span> behave a lot like a local ring and its maximal ideal, and we sometimes use the suggestive notation <span class="process-math">\((R,\fm)\)</span> to refer to it. Many properties of local rings also apply to the graded setting, so given a statement about local rings, you might take it as a suggestion that there might be a corresponding statement about graded rings â€” a statement that, nevertheless, still needs to be proved. There are usually some changes one needs to make to the statement; for example, if a theorem makes assertions about the ideals in a local ring, the corresponding graded statement will likely only apply to homogeneous ideals, and a theorem about finitely generated modules over a local ring will probably translate into a theorem about graded modules in the graded setting.</div>
