<div class="para">In general, we will show that we can choose <span class="process-math">\(x_1,\dots, x_i\in \fm\)</span> inductively such that every minimal prime of <span class="process-math">\(J_i= (x_1,\dots,x_i)\)</span> has height <span class="process-math">\(i\text{.}\)</span> The case <span class="process-math">\(i=0\)</span> is clear from the comment above. Say that we have chosen the first <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> elements. If <span class="process-math">\(i&lt;d\text{,}\)</span> note that <span class="process-math">\(\fm\)</span> is not a minimal prime of <span class="process-math">\(J_i\text{,}\)</span> as this would contradict . Note that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is noetherian and thus <span class="process-math">\(J_i\)</span> has finitely many minimal primes, by . Thus, by , we can choose <span class="process-math">\(x_{i+1} \in \fm\)</span> not in any minimal prime of <span class="process-math">\(J_i\text{.}\)</span> Then by  every minimal prime of <span class="process-math">\(J_{i+1} := J_i +(x_{i+1})\)</span> has height at most <span class="process-math">\(i+1\text{.}\)</span> On the other hand, every <span class="process-math">\(Q \in \Min(J_{i+1})\)</span> contains some <span class="process-math">\(P \in \Min(J_i)\text{,}\)</span> and in fact we must have <span class="process-math">\(Q \supsetneq P\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(x_{i+1}\in Q \smallsetminus P\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> has height <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P \supsetneq Q\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> must have height at least <span class="process-math">\(i+1\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> must have height exactly <span class="process-math">\(i+1\text{,}\)</span> completing the induction.</div>
