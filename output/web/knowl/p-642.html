<div class="para">We know that in noetherian rings, there can be arbitrarily long chains of primes, since the dimension can be infinite as in Nagataâ€™s . On the other hand, any ascending proper chain of primes is finite, as a consequence of the definition. Does this imply that every prime has finite height? This does not prevent that possibility that there could be an infinite descending chain of primes, which would then give any of the primes in the chain infinite height. (This seems strange in conjunction with the fact that in any ring, any prime contains a minimal prime, but it does not contradict this.) Another possible problem is there being two primes <span class="process-math">\(P \subseteq Q\)</span> such that for all <span class="process-math">\(n \geqslant 1\)</span> there exists a chain of primes of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span>
