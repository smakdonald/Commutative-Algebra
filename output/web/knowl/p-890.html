<div class="para">Despite its very concrete origins, modern homological algebra lives somewhere in the realm of abstract nonsense, and can be described as the study of abelian categories. An abelian category is, roughly speaking, modeled after Ab, the category of abelian groups and abelian group homomorphisms. It is this more general setting, rather than the classical topological setting, that we are interested in. However, it is very hard to understand general abelian categories without some good concrete examples we can get our hands on, so we should first start from a reasonable middle ground. While it might be very difficult to get a concrete handle on a general abelian category, it turns out that every reasonable abelian category embeds into <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-mod, the category of <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-modules and <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-module homomorphisms. In this first chapter we introduce the main characters - complexes, homology, categories and then we will spend most of our time studying <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-mod, while keeping in mind that what happens in a general abelian category is simply an abstraction of what happens in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span>-mod.</div>
