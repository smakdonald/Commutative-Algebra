<div class="para">The first part follows immediately from Lemma  and . Since we skipped the proof of Zariskiâ€™s Lemma, we give a proof of the case when <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is an uncountable field.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be an uncountable algebraically closed field and <span class="process-math">\(\fm\)</span> be any maximal ideal in <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(L := R/\fm \not\cong k\text{.}\)</span> Then there exists some element <span class="process-math">\(\alpha \in L\)</span> that is transcendental over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is an extension of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Now consider the set</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
S = \left\lbrace \frac{1}{\alpha-c} \mid c \in k \right\rbrace.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly dependent set over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> then we can find finitely many <span class="process-math">\(b_1, \ldots, b_n, c_1, \ldots, c_n \in k\)</span> such that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{b_1}{\alpha-c_1} + \cdots + \frac{b_n}{\alpha-c_n} = 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Rewriting the left side as one fraction, the numerator is a polynomial in <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> with coefficients in <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> is transcendental over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is a linearly independent set. But <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is uncountable, so <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is uncountable, and that means that <span class="process-math">\(\dim_k(L)\)</span> is uncountable. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is by construction algebra-finite over <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is a field, being algebra-finite and module-finite over <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> are equivalent conditions, and thus <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> should be a finite dimensional vector space over~<span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> This is a contradiction, so we cannot have any transcendental element over <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is algebraically closed, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(k = L\text{.}\)</span>

</div> <div class="para">To show the second statement, fix an ideal <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R = S/I\text{.}\)</span> The maximal ideal ideals in <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> are in bijection with the maximal ideals <span class="process-math">\(\fm\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> that contain <span class="process-math">\(I\text{;}\)</span> those are the ideals of the form <span class="process-math">\((x_1-a_1, \ldots, x_d-a_d)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq (x_1-a_1, \ldots, x_d-a_d)\text{.}\)</span> These are in bijection with the points <span class="process-math">\((a_1, \ldots, a_d) \in \mathbb{A}^d_k\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\((a_1, \ldots, a_d) \in \mathcal{Z}_k(I)\text{.}\)</span>
